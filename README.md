## QuickCharNet: Enhancing Search Engine Optimization Using Efficient Character-Level Convolutional Network for non-optimal URL Detection

## Introduction

This project is part of [QuickCharNet](). This project explores the use of deep learning techniques, specifically character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for URL classification. The goal is to classify URLs based on their appearance, which can be used for SEO optimization. to
