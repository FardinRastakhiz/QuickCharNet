## QuickCharNet: Enhancing Search Engine Optimization Using Efficient Character-Level Convolutional Network for non-optimal URL Detection

## Introduction

This project is part of [Quick Char Net](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729268). This project explores the use of deep learning techniques, specifically character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for URL classification. The goal is to classify URLs based on their appearance, which can be used for SEO optimization.

## Project Structure

- **datasets/**: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **FindBestModel/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for testing and identifying the best model.
- **TestsOnGrambedding/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for testing and comparing the model against state-of-the-art models using the Grambedding dataset.
- **TestsOnMaliciousURLs/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for testing and comparing the model against state-of-the-art models using the Malicious URLs dataset.
- **TestsOnPhishStorm/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for testing and comparing the model against state-of-the-art models using the PhishStorm dataset.
- **TestsOnSpamURLs/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for testing and comparing the model against state-of-the-art models using the Spam dataset.
- **Visualizations/**: Python scripts to show how models work include evaluations and how they create their outputs.
## Methodology

### QuickCharNet Architecture

***A brief explanation of the seed (here, 911):***
This model, like many others, works best with a specific initial state. Experimentally, it performed best using the fixed initial state with seed 911, although you might, theoretically or experimentally, find a better fixed or random initial state. The initial state 911 worked well with various datasets and learning conditionsâ€”not just under a single human-engineered condition.
